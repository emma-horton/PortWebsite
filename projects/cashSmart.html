											<h2>Problem</h2>
											<p>Financial literacy is a core life skill for participating in modern society. Young people struggle to save money effectively due to a lack of motivation, guidance, and tailored budgeting techniques.</p>
											<ul class="statistics">
												<li>üî∂ According to <em>Moneymarketing.co.uk</em>, a shocking 59% of young adults are considered financially illiterate.</li>
												<li>üî∂ According to the <em>Bank of England</em>, 89% of young people worry about money.</li>
												<li>üî∂ Internationally, the UK scores poorly on financial literacy (<em>Financial Times</em>).</li>
											</ul>
											<p>These are just a few of many statistics that describe the barriers faced by young people when it comes to their finances.</p>

										<section class="section inspiration">
											<h2>Inspiration</h2>
											<p>üë©‚Äçüíª To break barriers and build bridges in the realm of personal finance. By providing #accessible financial education and #innovative tools, CashSmart #empowers young people to gain the knowledge and skills they need to thrive financially.</p>

											<h2>What It Does</h2>
											<p>üìå We built a clickable prototype of our app CashSmart. Through our app, users can confidently navigate their financial decisions, track their progress, and connect with a supportive community that shares similar goals. CashSmart is the platform that enables young individuals to embrace their financial uniqueness and feel empowered on their journey towards financial well-being.</p>
											<p>üí¨ CashSmart is a mobile app that offers a gamified learning experience to empower users in their financial journey. With interactive modules and video formats, users can easily understand financial concepts and develop financial literacy. The app also includes goal setting and progress tracking features, along with a personal finance tracker, to help users achieve their financial goals and manage their finances effectively. Additionally, CashSmart fosters a supportive community where users can connect, share insights, and learn from each other's experiences. This community feature encourages collaboration and provides a platform for users to seek guidance and support on their financial path.</p>

											<h2>How We Built It</h2>
											<p>üî® To maximize our workflow, all of our documentation was in Figma and shared Google Drive. We met regularly over Zoom and Discord to brainstorm on FigJam and to communicate the next steps in our process.</p>
											<p>üó£ We began by conducting user research with 5 individuals who fit our audience criteria. In these interviews, we were able to understand and uncover the motivations, frustrations, and potential business and design opportunities from the participants.</p>
											<p>üñå Based on our research insights, we conducted an affinity mapping exercise to identify key themes and brainstorm solutions to address the identified problems. To ensure a consistent app experience, we developed a comprehensive design system that encompassed typography, colors, icons, and buttons in various states. Our design approach aimed to evoke a genuine, professional, supportive, and inclusive feel throughout the app. By incorporating these elements, we aimed to create an environment that fosters trust, encourages collaboration, and empowers users in their financial journey.</p>
											<p>üé® Following our brainstorming session, we began the design process by wireframing our ideas in Figma. We started with low-fidelity wireframes to establish the overall structure and layout. As we progressed, we iteratively refined the wireframes and transitioned to high-fidelity designs. To expedite the development process and save time, we decided to prioritize the creation of clickable interactions directly on the high-fidelity prototype. This approach allowed us to swiftly validate and iterate on the user experience while maintaining a consistent and polished design throughout.</p>

											<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>
											<ul>
												<li>üîπ All five of us joined the hackathon virtually, so there was a learning curve with figuring out our workflow at the beginning.</li>
												<li>üîπ For most of the team it was their first time participating in a hackathon, and although that is a challenge, it is one we gladly took on to create something we are passionate about!</li>
												<li>üîπ A few of us were well-versed in Figma, and for some, it was their first time. We overcame this challenge by helping each other out when we ran into roadblocks and learning along the way.</li>

										<section class="section what-we-learned">
											<h2>What We Learned</h2>
											<p>During our development journey with CashSmart, we gained insights on how to build an app from scratch using Figma. Through user interviews, we discovered a significant need for a personalized platform that empowers young people in their financial literacy journey. Existing mainstream solutions often lack the inclusivity and effectiveness required to address this need. To bridge this gap, CashSmart offers a personalized experience where users can select dedicated learning paths tailored to their specific needs. Our app incorporates easy-to-digest videos that simplify complex financial concepts, as well as quizzes to reinforce and apply newly acquired knowledge. By providing these features, CashSmart aims to empower young individuals and foster their financial literacy, building bridges and promoting inclusivity along the way.</p>
